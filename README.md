# Bike?
Android application that tells users whether it is a good or bad day to ride their bike based on their personalized weather specifications.

## Prerequisites
The only prerequisite is an [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org) API key.

## Setup
- Clone the master branch in this repository.
- Update the weather API key constant in the `Util/Constants` file to your [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org) API key.
- The app should now run without any issues.

## How to use?
- **Make sure the app is up and running.**
-  Click the settings button in the top right corner to set your preferred biking weather conditions and location.
-  Once your preferences are set, you should be redirected back to home screen where some content should now be displayed.
-  You can cycle through the upcoming 7 days to check if the weather for those days matches your preferred biking preferences.
-  That's it! It's fairly simple and easy to use but can be useful if you don't want to use weather apps which are not always fully customizable.
